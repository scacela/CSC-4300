              First I used some of my old work as a template
              (a page featuring a styled table filled with playable music)
              and broke it down almost completely before building back onto it.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li id= "li2">
            <p class= "bulletDistance">
              I opened the Assignment 1 page adjacent to the page I was working
              on for ease of comparison.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li id= "li3">
            <p class= "bulletDistance">
              Along the way, I often turned to google (mostly w3schools.com) to
              learn or relearn something quickly whenever I got stuck.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li id= "li4">
            <p class= "bulletDistance">
              This was a neat project that required focus and fidelity. I'm glad
              that I got a chance to revisit HTML, JS, and CSS, and am sure that
              what I learned and relearned will come in handy down the road!
